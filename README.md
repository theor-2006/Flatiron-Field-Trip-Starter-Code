# WHSAT Google Field Trip: 404 Page Activity
### *January 22, 2024*

- For this challenge you will be tasked with creating a 404 Error Page! 404 is a status code that tells the user that the requested page is not available.  

- They will usually be pages with not a lot of content: usually an image and some text centered on the page.
- Sometimes they have an appropriate joke or some specific information about why that page isn't available.
    - For example, [Taco Bell's 404 page](https://www.tacobell.com/404) reads,
      - "**The page you are looking for does not exist.**
(Unless you were looking for a page with an animation of a taco tripping and literally spilling the beans. If that's the case, it definitely exists, and you definitely found it.)"
    - Google's 404 page is a bit more utilitarian. [It says](http://google.com/404),
      - "404. That’s an error. The requested URL /404 was not found on this server. That’s all we know."
      
We've already provided you the navbar that users use to get to various pages on Google.com. 

### Your Challenge

Your task is to create one of your own!

**Some things we'll be looking for**

- Did you change the background color, font, and other things about the look and feel of the site? Did you make it more like Google's existing site, or did you take a creative twist on it?
- Did you write a message explaining what the error is?
- Did you literally include the numbers "404"? Is the text just plain text, or did you apply effects to the text in some way? 
- Generally, JavaScript is discouraged on 404 pages. *But*, did you use JavaScript in a way that's interesting without being annoying or distracting?
